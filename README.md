# Camera Positioning System with Homography
2021-12-05
## Demo: https://youtu.be/Kk6x1lHnKw8
## Introduction
Camera guidance system for drone using Python program and OpenCV library. This project uses SIFT algorithm for feature extraction, FLANN-based feature matching, and homography transformation matrix for detecting an uploaded image in a video.
## How to Use:
Replace print statements with movement commands. Replace image import with desired image for tracking.
